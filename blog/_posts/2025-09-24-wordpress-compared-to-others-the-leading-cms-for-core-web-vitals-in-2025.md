In the ever-evolving landscape of website performance, Google’s Core Web Vitals (CWV) have become a critical benchmark for user experience and SEO rankings. As of 2025, while WordPress remains the most widely used content management system (CMS), its performance in CWV metrics lags behind several competitors. This article delves into how WordPress stacks up against other leading CMS platforms in terms of Core Web Vitals.

## Understanding Core Web Vitals

Core Web Vitals are a set of performance metrics introduced by Google to quantify user experience on the web. The three primary metrics are:

* **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** Measures loading performance.
* **First Input Delay (FID):** Assesses interactivity.
* **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):** Evaluates visual stability.

A "good" score for each metric is defined as:

* **LCP:** ≤ 2.5 seconds
* **FID:** ≤ 100 milliseconds
* **CLS:** ≤ 0.1

## WordPress Performance in 2025

Despite its dominance in market share, WordPress faces challenges in achieving optimal Core Web Vitals scores. As of mid-2025, only **43.44%** of WordPress sites met the CWV thresholds, placing it at the bottom among major CMS platforms.

## Factors Affecting WordPress Performance

* **Theme and Plugin Quality:** Poorly coded themes and an overabundance of plugins can significantly hinder performance.
* **Hosting Environment:** Shared hosting solutions often lack the resources necessary for optimal performance.
* **Lack of Built-in Optimization:** Unlike some competitors, WordPress does not come with built-in performance optimization tools.

## Competitor CMS Performance

### 1. Duda

Duda leads the CWV rankings with **84.96%** of sites passing the Core Web Vitals thresholds. Its focus on agencies and developers, combined with a streamlined platform, contributes to its superior performance.

### 2. Wix

Wix ranks third, with **70.76%** of its websites achieving good CWV scores. Notably, **86.82%** of Wix sites have a good INP (Interaction to Next Paint) score, indicating strong interactivity.

### 3. Squarespace

Squarespace holds the fourth position, with **67.66%** of sites meeting CWV criteria. It excels in INP performance, with **95.85%** of sites achieving a good score, reflecting its emphasis on user interaction.

### 4. Drupal

Drupal's performance is commendable, with **59.07%** of sites passing CWV standards. However, it ranks last in INP scores, with only **85.5%** of sites achieving a good score.

## Why WordPress Trails Behind

Several factors contribute to WordPress's subpar CWV performance:

* **Customization Complexity:** While WordPress offers extensive customization, achieving optimal performance requires technical expertise.
* **Plugin Dependency:** The reliance on third-party plugins for functionality can introduce inefficiencies and conflicts.
* **Performance Optimization:** Users must actively implement performance optimization strategies, such as leveraging Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and caching mechanisms.

## Strategies to Enhance WordPress Performance

To improve Core Web Vitals scores on WordPress:

* **Choose Lightweight Themes:** Opt for themes optimized for performance.
* **Limit Plugin Usage:** Use only essential plugins and ensure they are well-coded.
* **Implement Caching Solutions:** Utilize caching plugins and CDNs to reduce load times.
* **Optimize Images and Assets:** Compress images and defer non-essential JavaScript to improve loading speeds.

## Conclusion

While WordPress remains a powerful and flexible CMS, its performance in Core Web Vitals lags behind several competitors. Platforms like Duda, Wix, and Squarespace have made significant strides in optimizing user experience metrics, setting a high bar for performance. For WordPress users, achieving competitive performance requires diligent optimization and a proactive approach to site management.

As the digital landscape continues to prioritize user experience, selecting a CMS that aligns with performance goals is crucial for maintaining visibility and competitiveness in search rankings.
